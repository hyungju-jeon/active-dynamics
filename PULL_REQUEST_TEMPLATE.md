# Pull Request: Comprehensive Code Quality Improvements

## Summary

This PR addresses critical bugs, adds comprehensive type hints, improves memory efficiency, and enhances code quality throughout the active-dynamics codebase.

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### BaseAction.forward() Logic Error
- **Issue**: Method was calling `self.network(action)` twice, causing incorrect behavior
- **Fix**: Corrected control flow to properly handle state-dependent and state-independent cases
- **Impact**: Prevents incorrect action encoding that could affect training

### Missing Type Annotation
- **Issue**: `env_dt = 0.1` in config.py was missing type annotation
- **Fix**: Added `env_dt: float = 0.1`
- **Impact**: Enables proper type checking and IDE support

### Broken Validation Functions
- **Issue**: Critical validation functions were commented out and incomplete
- **Fix**: Implemented proper `validate_elbo()` and `validate_kstep_r2()` functions
- **Impact**: Enables proper model validation during experiments

## 🔧 Type Hints & Documentation

- Added comprehensive type hints throughout core modules (Agent, Experiment, base classes)
- Replaced Union syntax (`|`) with `Union[]` for better Python version compatibility
- Added detailed docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises sections
- Enhanced documentation for better maintainability

## ⚡ Efficiency Improvements

### Memory Management
- Enhanced `Rollout.clear()` method with explicit tensor deletion
- Added proper CUDA memory cleanup and garbage collection
- Optimized data handling to reduce memory footprint

### Performance Optimizations
- Improved collate functions with proper typing
- More efficient tensor operations
- Better resource management during training

## 📚 Code Quality Enhancements

- Standardized error handling patterns throughout the codebase
- Added comprehensive module documentation
- Improved consistency in coding style and patterns
- Enhanced validation and edge case handling

## 🛠️ Development Tools

- Added MyPy configuration for ongoing type checking
- Created comprehensive documentation for future development
- Provided roadmap for continued improvements

## 📊 Testing & Validation

All changes have been thoroughly tested to ensure:
- ✅ Core functionality remains intact
- ✅ Memory management improvements work correctly
- ✅ Type hints are properly defined and functional
- ✅ Critical bugs are resolved
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
