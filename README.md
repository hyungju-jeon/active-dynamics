# Active Dynamics

Active Learning for Latent Dynamical System Identification

## Overview

This project implements active learning algorithms for identifying latent dynamical systems.

## Features

- Vector field environments with different dynamics (limit cycle, double limit cycle, multi-attractor)
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models for latent space learning
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies
- Active learning algorithms for efficient data collection
- Fisher Information metrics for uncertainty quantification
